# SpazTwitch
A simple script I wrote to install a custom Twitch smiley theme to my linux machine. Currently only supporting Linux, it will create a new Pigdin smiley theme to your Pidgin smiley folder (~/.purple/smileys) where it will create a new folder and download the entirety of the icon set to your machine.

To save on bandwidth, I will only download images that were not installed on a previous installation.

## Idea
I originally used [alexzah's](https://developer.pidgin.im/raw-attachment/wiki/ThirdPartySmileyThemes/twitch_smiley_theme.tar.gz) original smiley theme, but the pack was out of date and missed some of the core smileys. What I wanted to do was use the API at [TwitchEmotes](http://twitchemotes.com/) and have the ability to keep my icons up-to-date without having to worry about re-downloading and re-installing from a tarball constantly.


## Thanks
I want to thank TwitchEmotes for providing the API that makes this entire thing possible, and to twitch for providing the images as well as providing nice and clean URLs to download the images from.
